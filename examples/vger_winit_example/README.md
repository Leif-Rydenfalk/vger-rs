# 2D Graphics Application with `wgpu`, `winit`, and `vger`

This Rust application demonstrates how to create a basic 2D graphics application using the `wgpu` library (for GPU rendering), the `winit` library (for window management and event handling), and the custom `vger` library (for high-level 2D graphics rendering). The application renders a simple red circle and some sample text to the window.

## Features

- Initializes a window with `winit`.
- Sets up GPU rendering with `wgpu` and renders graphics with `vger`.
- Supports window resizing and automatic content scaling.
- Displays a red circle and some text on the screen.
- Works in both native environments (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux) and WebAssembly (WASM).

## Modules and Dependencies

### `wgpu`

`wgpu` is a safe, modern WebGPU implementation for Rust. It provides access to the GPU for graphics and compute tasks. In this application, `wgpu` is used to:

- Create and configure the GPU device.
- Manage the surface (the window) to which graphics will be rendered.
- Submit rendering commands.

### `winit`

`winit` is a cross-platform window creation and event handling library. It is used to:

- Create a window for rendering.
- Handle window events, such as resizing, close requests, and redraw requests.
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility (including support for WebAssembly in browsers).

### `vger`

`vger` is a custom high-level graphics library used for 2D drawing. It simplifies drawing shapes, text, and other graphics on the screen using `wgpu`. In this example, it is used to:

- Draw shapes (e.g., circles).
- Render text.
- Provide a higher-level abstraction for GPU rendering.

## Application Structure

### `DrawContext`

The `DrawContext` structure holds the state necessary for rendering:

- **`surface`**: The window surface that is rendered to.
- **`device`**: The GPU device used to interact with the hardware.
- **`config`**: The surface configuration, including window size, format, and other parameters.
- **`vger`**: The `Vger` instance used to perform high-level 2D drawing.

### `setup` (Async)

This function is responsible for setting up the rendering context. It performs the following tasks:

- Initializes the `wgpu` instance and selects a GPU adapter.
- Creates the surface (i.e., the window) for rendering.
- Configures the GPU device and queue.
- Sets up the `vger` library for rendering.

### `render`

The `render` function is responsible for drawing content to the screen using `vger`. It performs the following tasks:

- Saving and restoring drawing state.
- Translates the drawing context.
- Draws a red circle at the center of the window.
- Renders sample text.

### `App`

The `App` struct represents the application and holds the window and rendering context. It implements the `ApplicationHandler` trait from `winit` to manage window events and the application lifecycle.

- **`window`**: An `Option` containing the window (if it exists).
- **`context`**: An `Option` containing the `DrawContext` (if the context has been initialized).

### `ApplicationHandler` Implementation

The `App` struct implements the `ApplicationHandler` trait, which provides methods for handling various events:

- **`resumed`**: Initializes the window and rendering context when the application is resumed. This is where the `setup` function is called.
- **`window_event`**: Handles window events, including:
  - **CloseRequested**: Exits the event loop when the user closes the window.
  - **Resized**: Updates the surface configuration when the window is resized, and triggers a redraw.
  - **RedrawRequested**: Handles the actual rendering. It updates the rendering context, clears the frame, and presents the rendered content to the screen.

## Usage

### Building and Running

To build and run the application, follow these steps:

1. If you're targeting a native platform (Windows, macOS, Linux):

   - Build and run the project as a regular Rust application:
     ```bash
     cargo run -p basic
     ```

2. Once the application is running, a window will appear, and the red circle and text will be rendered to the screen. Resize the window, and the graphics will adjust accordingly.

### Customization

- **Text Rendering**: To render custom text, modify the string passed to the `vger.text()` function in the `render` function.
- **Shapes**: Add more shapes (e.g., rectangles, lines) using the `vger` API to customize what is drawn to the screen.
- **Window Size**: The window's size is automatically adjusted when resized by the user, and the application will reconfigure the GPU surface accordingly.

## Notes

- **WebAssembly (WASM)**: When targeting WebAssembly, the canvas is directly added to the HTML body. This is handled by the `winit` library in the `setup` function under the `#[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]` section.
- **`vger` Library**: The `vger` library is a higher-level abstraction built on top of `wgpu`, designed for easy drawing of 2D graphics. You can extend it to create more complex drawings.
